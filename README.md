Project Description: This projects aim is to build an uncertainty-aware GNN framework that treats neural networks and knowledge graphs as computational graphs, approximates internal activations, quantifies epistemic uncertainty, and uses graph theoretic metrics + interventions to identify robust vs fragile subcircuits, improving mechanistic interpretability and safety.
